# Caption Cafe

Online repository of captions and subtitles for anime and other Asian media.

The code can be reused for other caption aggregator websites, but it's geared towards being a Kitsunekko mirror with additional metadata, user control, and management tools.

The idea is to link subtitle files to anime database entries, make searching easier, add source of the captions (e.g. TV, web, manual transcription), compatibility of timing to video versions, file reporting, and some indicators of caption quality (to filter out inevitable trash uploads).
